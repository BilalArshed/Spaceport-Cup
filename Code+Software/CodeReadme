Here is where all our code in matlab or anything else shall go. Github allows for .txt code editing so you can paste your matlab code in this folder to
share it with others and then see any changes made, also github allows version control so if you're uploading a new version of a part, create a new branch, 
replace the file in the branch and then make a pull request to pull it into the main branch once its finalised
