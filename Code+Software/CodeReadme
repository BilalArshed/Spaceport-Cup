Here is where all our code in matlab or anything else shall go. Github allows for .m code editing so you can upload your matlab code in this folder to
share it with others and then see any changes made, then when you want to use it you can redownload it to your MATLAB folder. Also github allows version 
control so if you're uploading a new version of a part, create a new branch, replace the file in the branch and then make a pull request to pull it into 
the main branch once its finalised
