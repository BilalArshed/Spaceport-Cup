This is where all CAD files will go, github allows version control so we don't need to fuck around with "strut v2 is missing from this assembly" stuff, 
if you're uploading a new version of a part, create a new branch, replace the file in the branch and then make a pull request to pull it into the main 
branch once its finalised
